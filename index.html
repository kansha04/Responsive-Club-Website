            <h2>About Our Club</h2>
            <p>Founded by friends during a meteor shower viewing party, the Stargazers Society has grown into a vibrant community of over 85 members. We believe the night sky belongs to everyone and aim to make astronomy accessible, educational, and <span style="font-family: Baskervville; font-style: italic;">magical</span> for our  community.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Join us for our monthly Star Parties, held every third Saturday at Riverside Park's observatory deck. Use personal or club telescopes to explore planets, nebulae, and distant galaxies while enjoying complimentary hot cocoa and stargazing maps. We also offer hands-on workshops on topics like astrophotography, telescope maintenance, meteor shower viewing guides, and navigation.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-weight:700;">In addition to our regular events, we host special gatherings throughout the year, including our annual <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Baskervville;">Perseid Meteor Shower Camping Trip</span>, solar eclipse viewings, and guest lectures. We're also passionate about community outreach, bringing interactive presentations and telescope demonstrations to local schools and libraries.</p>

            <h2>New Member Spotlight</h2>
            <p style="width: 70%;">"I joined the Stargazers Society six months ago as a <span style="font-weight: 700;">complete beginner,</span> and it's been incredible! The members are so welcoming and patient. I've learned to identify dozens of constellations and even captured my first photo of Saturn. This club has given me a new perspective on the universe and some wonderful friends."</p>
